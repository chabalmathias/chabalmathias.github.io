	abstract = {The glacial geology of Maine records the northward recession of the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet, followed by development of a residual ice cap in the Maine-Québec border region due to marine transgression of the St. Lawrence Lowland in Canada. The pattern of deglaciation across southern Maine has been reconstructed from numerous end moraines, deltas and submarine fans deposited during marine transgression of the coastal lowland. Inland from the marine limit, a less-detailed sequence of deglaciation is recorded by striation patterns, meltwater channels, scattered moraines and waterlain deposits that constrain the trend of the ice margin. There is no evidence that the northern Maine ice cap extended as far south-west as the Boundary Mountains and New Hampshire border. Newly-obtained radiocarbon ages from marine and terrestrial ice-proximal environments have improved the chronology of glacial recession in Maine. Many of these ages were obtained by coring Late-glacial sediments beneath ponds and lakes. Data from this study show that the state was deglaciated between about 14.5 and 10.0 ka BP (14C years). The coastal moraine belt in southern Maine was deposited by oscillatory ice-margin retreat during the cold pre-Bølling time. Rapid ice recession to northern Maine then occurred between 13 and 11 ka BP, during the warmer Bølling/Allerød chronozones. Radiocarbon-dated pond sediments in western and northern Maine show lithological evidence of Younger Dryas climatic cooling and persistence of the northern ice cap into Younger Dryas time. A large discrepancy still exists between radiocarbon ages of deglaciation in coastal south-western Maine and the timing of ice retreat indicated by New England varve records in areas to the west. Part of this problem may stem from the uncertainty of reservoir corrections applied to the radiocarbon ages of marine organics.},

	abstract = {Environmental models are simplifications of the real world, which seek to represent highly complex systems, in order to predict likely outcomes, Approaches have been developed to predict soil erosion by water, at the hillslope scale. A number of conceptual approaches are discussed, from the empirically based algorithm of the 1960s, the Universal Soil Loss Equation, through to its process-based successor the Water Erosion Prediction Project, alongside a range of other models that have been developed over the last five decades. Scales of model application are discussed, illustrating the range of space and time that models are applied across and the different problems that are associated with overcoming the scaling problem in soil erosion prediction. The evaluation of soil erosion models is detailed, first in terms of model sensitivity analyses and then in terms of model uncertainty analyses. Finally, the chapter focuses on recent models, which have been developed as research tools, to explore understanding of the physics of erosion. One such model, Model for the Assessment of Hillslope to Landscape Erosion, Runoff and Nutrients (MAHLERAN), is proposed as an approach that may be followed to improve both process representation in soil erosion models and the way in which erosion models are developed, in dialog with field data collection and laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Debris transported by glacier is derived either supraglacially from nunataks and valley sides or from erosion of the subglacial bed. Debris produced above the glacier by fracturing of rock walls has a dominant coarse fraction with angular boulders. Subsequent englacial or supraglacial transport is relatively passive and little comminution occurs. Debris eroded from subglacial bedrock is initially transported in a basal zone of traction, where particles frequently come into contact with the glacier bed and are retarded by it so that large forces may be generated between particles and the bed and at interparticle contacts. The material introduced into this tractional zone may be subglacial bedrock which has undergone a crushing-plucking event and which has a dominant coarse fraction, or supraglacially derived material which finds its way to the glacier bed. These parent debris assemblages are further comminuted by failure in response to locally concentrated compressive stresses, and attrition at shearing interfaces. Boulders transported through the tractional zone will tend to be rounded and bear several directions of striation. Large boulders embedded in lodgement till will tend to be streamlined with striae parallel to glacier flow and with an abruptly truncated distal extremity, rather like a roche moutonnée. Textural and boulder shape characteristics can be used to help distinguish different types of till.},

The models are compared to a multiple regression model derived from the same data. The comparison demonstrates that in natural rivers, using an exponent on the slope variable of 0.33 rather than the traditional value of 0.5 reduces the variance associated with estimating flow resistance. Mean model uncertainty, assuming a constant value for the conductance coefficient, is less than 5\% for a large number of estimates, and 67\% of the estimates would be accurate within 50\%. The models have potential application where site-specific flow resistance information is not available and can be the basis for (1) a general approach to estimating discharge from remotely sensed hydraulic data, (2) comparison to slope-area discharge estimates, and (3) large-scale river modeling.},

We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

Glacier retreat exposes glacigenic and glacially conditioned sediment sources (rockwalls, drift-mantled slopes, valley-floor glacigenic deposits, and coastal glacigenic deposits) in an unstable or metastable state. During sediment reworking, source-to-sink transport is interrupted by storage in a range of paraglacial landforms such as talus, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, deltas, and coastal barrier deposits. Because glacigenic sediment sources are nonrenewable, paraglacial sediment flux can be approximated by an exhaustion model, and sediment stores experience a transition from net accumulation to net degradation. Six paraglacial land systems are identified (rock-slope adjustment, drift-mantled slopes, glacier forelands, and alluvial, lacustrine, and coastal settings). Paraglacial effects dominate the postglacial geomorphic evolution of most glaciated environments.},

Mechanisms of construction, evolution, and dismantling of volcanic edifices are examined with descriptions using well-known examples and models. Limitations and imperfections within models for hot spot volcanism are mainly related to the specific context and scale, and to magmatology. At the oceanic scale, the models are influenced by the geodynamic context (plate motion and proximity of a subduction or an accretion zone). At the volcanic edifice scale, the models are constrained by the history of the volcano development, for example, cones superimpositions, proximity of fractures, zone of weakness, stress field, major mass wasting, and rift zones.},

	abstract = {The distributions and abundances of trout and salmon are strongly influenced by their habitat. The habitat includes both abiotic and biotic factors, which interact in complex webs. Habitat probably has strongest effects during population bottlenecks, when the standing stock approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. Various approaches to modelling interactions between habitat and population density and mean weight have been explored, but further work is needed in this area of investigation. The importance of depth, current, substrate, cover, and to a lesser extent, temperature and oxygen availability to the various stages of the life cycles of salmon and trout are briefly reviewed. By drawing on published data, it is possible to define broad ranges of acceptable conditions for the life stages of each species. However, it is not possible to partition this variation into between-population differences, within-population preferences, within-population tolerances, and effects of interactions between habitat variables. To pursue this important issue further, a structured approach using experimentation both in the field and in suitable laboratory systems is recommended. There is abundant evidence that habitat requirements of salmon and trout overlap. Trout tend to out-compete salmon except often in areas of particularly fast flows and, perhaps, remote from the river bank. The habitat requirements of year classes of salmon and trout overlap and therefore, there is scope for interactions between them depending on the spatial arrangement of habitats and the occurrence of bottlenecks. It is particularly important to understand where the bottlenecks to production lie and to focus on these in the first instance. Otherwise, there is a risk of manipulating habitat that is already in excess, or increasing numbers of a population that will subsequently be constrained, e.g., by over-wintering habitat. For this reason, it is prudent to accept that although manipulations of habitat may appear to be beneficial when considered locally, they should be measured and assessed where possible in terms of the production of returning adults and/or high quality smolts. Because of the complexity of interactions between salmon, trout, and the animals that eat them, it is at present difficult, or impossible, to derive good predictive models of the effects of manipulating habitats under many circumstances.},

This study aims at reconstructing the chronology of late Pleistocene glacial fluctuations in the Aubrac Mountains. We present a new set of Be-10 and Al-26 exposure ages from twenty erratic boulders embedded in six glacial landforms. Glacial landforms were sampled to determine the timing of three glacial stades and the deglaciation of the Aubrac Mountains. These new data allowed us to constrain the timing of: (i) the Local Last Glacial Maximum, which is coeval with the early Marine Isotopic Stage 2 (MIS 2) (28–24 ka), and (ii) the Grandvals and Bouquincan stades, which are both coeval with the late MIS 2 (24–16 ka). Deglaciation occurred during Heinrich Stadial 1 (18–15.6 ka). This new direct glacial chronology is supported by regional paleoenvironmental proxies and it updates the chronostratigraphic framework available for the southwestern Massif Central. Western European atmospheric circulation changes (i.e., a southward shift in North Atlantic storm tracks and Mediterranean influences) during MIS 2 were identified as significant factors controlling glacier growth in the Aubrac Mountains as well as other glaciated mountains within the southwestern Massif Central, such as the Cantal, Margeride and Lozère mountains.},

Spatially continuous data sets are increasingly available at a national scale (e.g., digital elevation models or aerial orthophotographs) and open up new possibilities to investigate spatial structures in stream networks. The paper introduces a GIS methodological framework to support and automate the large-scale characterization of the fluvial system based on spatial disaggregation and aggregation procedures. The spatial disaggregation consists in the longitudinal discretisation of geographical objects into relatively high resolution spatial units to characterize fluvial features continuously along stream networks. Because rivers are heterogeneous and hierarchically organized, the spatial aggregation aims to delineate statistically pattern or process-based spatial units to answer questions at appropriate scales. The paper develops the GIS implementation of the disaggregation and aggregation procedures for characterizing stream networks in a geomorphic perspective. We illustrate the approach on the Rhône network, focusing on the characterization of three geographical objects commonly used in classification schemes: the streamline, the valley bottom, and the active channel (the latter on a limited area). The spatial aggregation is automated using the threshold test of Pettitt (1979) to detect change points in univariate data series and delineate homogeneous spatial units throughout the stream network. We provide three simple application examples to illustrate the potentialities of the spatial aggregation to investigate spatial heterogeneity in stream networks. Finally, insights, limitations and future challenging issues emerging from the application of the methodological framework are discussed.},

Overbank deposits consist primarily of silt and clay and lesser amounts of sand, and often encase sand bodies. Organic and chemical sediments such as peat and carbonate can be important constituents of overbank sediments in humid and arid settings, respectively. Fluvial sediments are present in a diverse array of environments that range from tectonically quiescent continental interiors to actively subsiding continental margins and foreland basins. The geologic setting controls the abundance of fluvial sediments, the completeness of the record of fluvial activity, and the architecture of the deposits. In continental interiors where erosion predominates, fluvial sediments are often represented by down-stepping flights of terraces underlain by sand and/or gravel. Fine-grained overbank deposits are often rare in these settings. Periods of fluvial aggradation and sediment reworking are punctuated by river incision and soil formation. Records of fluvial activity in these settings are relatively incomplete. Along continental margins, fluvial sediments are represented by relative thick successions of muddy overbank and sandy channel deposits. Stacked deposits of Quaternary fluvial sediments in these settings provide relatively complete and long-term records of fluvial activity.},

	abstract = {The need for integration across spatial and temporal scales in applying science to the management of Atlantic salmon is considered. The factors that are currently believed to affect the production of anadromous adult Atlantic salmon (synthesized from recent reviews) are arranged in a hierarchy in which any given process overrides those processes at lower levels. There is not a good correlation between levels in the process hierarchy and levels in hierarchies of scale. This demonstrates the importance of integrating across scales in identifying the optimum foci for targeting management action. It is not possible to generalize on the need for integration across scales within management plans. This is because of the complex ecology of salmon, the broad range of characteristics of the systems of which they are a part, and the fact that both local scale and broad scale management can have broad scale effects. Many uncertainties remain regarding the large-scale components of the ecology of salmon, the way that small-scale mechanisms interact with life histories, and the way that different factors interact to limit production of fish. When more is understood of these processes, it is likely that generalized rules might be developed to predict the management requirements for stream systems. In the meantime, it is essential that there is good integration among managers working at different scales and it is important that management systems operating at all spatial scales include high-calibre expertise to compensate for the present paucity of general rules.},

	abstract = {Glacier-erosion rates range across orders of magnitude, and much of this variation cannot be attributed to basal sliding rates. Subglacial till acts as lubricating ‘fault gouge’ or ‘sawdust’, and must be removed for rapid subglacial bedrock erosion. Such erosion occurs especially where and when moulin-fed streams access the bed and are unconstrained by supercooling or other processes. Streams also may directly erode bedrock, likely with strong time-evolution. Erosion is primarily by quarrying, aided by strong fluctuations in the water system driven by variable surface melt and by subglacial earthquakes. Debris-bed friction significantly affects abrasion, quarrying and general glacier flow. Frost heave drives cirque headwall erosion as winter cold air enters bergschrunds, creating temperature gradients to drive water flow along premelted films to growing ice lenses that fracture rock, and the glacier removes the resulting blocks. Recent subglacial bedrock erosion and sediment flux are in many cases much higher than long-term averages. Over glacial cycles, evolution of glacial-valley form feeds back strongly on erosion and deposition. Most of this is poorly quantified, with parts open to argument. Glacial erosion and interactions are important to tectonic and volcanic processes as well as climate and biogeochemical fluxes, motivating vigorous research.},

Scales of model application are discussed, illustrating the range of space and time that models are applied across and the different problems that are associated with overcoming the scaling problem in soil erosion prediction.

One such model, Model for the Assessment of Hillslope to Landscape Erosion, Runoff and Nutrients (MAHLERAN), is proposed as an approach that may be followed to improve both process representation in soil erosion models and the way in which erosion models are developed, in dialog with field data collection and laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {The glacial geology of Maine records the northward recession of the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet, followed by development of a residual ice cap in the Maine-Québec border region due to marine transgression of the St. Lawrence Lowland in Canada. The pattern of deglaciation across southern Maine has been reconstructed from numerous end moraines, deltas and submarine fans deposited during marine transgression of the coastal lowland. Inland from the marine limit, a less-detailed sequence of deglaciation is recorded by striation patterns, meltwater channels, scattered moraines and waterlain deposits that constrain the trend of the ice margin. There is no evidence that the northern Maine ice cap extended as far south-west as the Boundary Mountains and New Hampshire border. Newly-obtained radiocarbon ages from marine and terrestrial ice-proximal environments have improved the chronology of glacial recession in Maine. Many of these ages were obtained by coring Late-glacial sediments beneath ponds and lakes. Data from this study show that the state was deglaciated between about 14.5 and 10.0 ka BP (14C years). The coastal moraine belt in southern Maine was deposited by oscillatory ice-margin retreat during the cold pre-Bølling time. Rapid ice recession to northern Maine then occurred between 13 and 11 ka BP, during the warmer Bølling/Allerød chronozones. Radiocarbon-dated pond sediments in western and northern Maine show lithological evidence of Younger Dryas climatic cooling and persistence of the northern ice cap into Younger Dryas time. A large discrepancy still exists between radiocarbon ages of deglaciation in coastal south-western Maine and the timing of ice retreat indicated by New England varve records in areas to the west. Part of this problem may stem from the uncertainty of reservoir corrections applied to the radiocarbon ages of marine organics.},

Debris produced above the glacier by fracturing of rock walls has a dominant coarse fraction with angular boulders. Subsequent englacial or supraglacial transport is relatively passive and little comminution occurs. Debris eroded from subglacial bedrock is initially transported in a basal zone of traction, where particles frequently come into contact with the glacier bed and are retarded by it so that large forces may be generated between particles and the bed and at interparticle contacts. The material introduced into this tractional zone may be subglacial bedrock which has undergone a crushing-plucking event and which has a dominant coarse fraction, or supraglacially derived material which finds its way to the glacier bed. These parent debris assemblages are further comminuted by failure in response to locally concentrated compressive stresses, and attrition at shearing interfaces. Boulders transported through the tractional zone will tend to be rounded and bear several directions of striation. Large boulders embedded in lodgement till will tend to be streamlined with striae parallel to glacier flow and with an abruptly truncated distal extremity, rather like a roche moutonnée. Textural and boulder shape characteristics can be used to help distinguish different types of till.},

Glacier retreat exposes glacigenic and glacially conditioned sediment sources (rockwalls, drift-mantled slopes, valley-floor glacigenic deposits, and coastal glacigenic deposits) in an unstable or metastable state. During sediment reworking, source-to-sink transport is interrupted by storage in a range of paraglacial landforms such as talus, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, deltas, and coastal barrier deposits. Because glacigenic sediment sources are nonrenewable, paraglacial sediment flux can be approximated by an exhaustion model, and sediment stores experience a transition from net accumulation to net degradation. Six paraglacial land systems are identified (rock-slope adjustment, drift-mantled slopes, glacier forelands, and alluvial, lacustrine, and coastal settings). Paraglacial effects dominate the postglacial geomorphic evolution of most glaciated environments.},

The models are compared to a multiple regression model derived from the same data. The comparison demonstrates that in natural rivers, using an exponent on the slope variable of 0.33 rather than the traditional value of 0.5 reduces the variance associated with estimating flow resistance. Mean model uncertainty, assuming a constant value for the conductance coefficient, is less than 5\% for a large number of estimates, and 67\% of the estimates would be accurate within 50\%. The models have potential application where site-specific flow resistance information is not available and can be the basis for (1) a general approach to estimating discharge from remotely sensed hydraulic data, (2) comparison to slope-area discharge estimates, and (3) large-scale river modeling.},

Using high-resolution data from OpenStreetMap and a satellite-derived time series of urbanization, we compute and validate changes over time in multidimensional street connectivity measures based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

Mechanisms of construction, evolution, and dismantling of volcanic edifices are examined with descriptions using well-known examples and models. Limitations and imperfections within models for hot spot volcanism are mainly related to the specific context and scale, and to magmatology. At the oceanic scale, the models are influenced by the geodynamic context (plate motion and proximity of a subduction or an accretion zone). At the volcanic edifice scale, the models are constrained by the history of the volcano development, for example, cones superimpositions, proximity of fractures, zone of weakness, stress field, major mass wasting, and rift zones.},

	abstract = {The distributions and abundances of trout and salmon are strongly influenced by their habitat. The habitat includes both abiotic and biotic factors, which interact in complex webs. Habitat probably has strongest effects during population bottlenecks, when the standing stock approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. Various approaches to modelling interactions between habitat and population density and mean weight have been explored, but further work is needed in this area of investigation. The importance of depth, current, substrate, cover, and to a lesser extent, temperature and oxygen availability to the various stages of the life cycles of salmon and trout are briefly reviewed. By drawing on published data, it is possible to define broad ranges of acceptable conditions for the life stages of each species. However, it is not possible to partition this variation into between-population differences, within-population preferences, within-population tolerances, and effects of interactions between habitat variables. To pursue this important issue further, a structured approach using experimentation both in the field and in suitable laboratory systems is recommended. There is abundant evidence that habitat requirements of salmon and trout overlap. Trout tend to out-compete salmon except often in areas of particularly fast flows and, perhaps, remote from the river bank. The habitat requirements of year classes of salmon and trout overlap and therefore, there is scope for interactions between them depending on the spatial arrangement of habitats and the occurrence of bottlenecks. It is particularly important to understand where the bottlenecks to production lie and to focus on these in the first instance. Otherwise, there is a risk of manipulating habitat that is already in excess, or increasing numbers of a population that will subsequently be constrained, e.g., by over-wintering habitat. For this reason, it is prudent to accept that although manipulations of habitat may appear to be beneficial when considered locally, they should be measured and assessed where possible in terms of the production of returning adults and/or high quality smolts. Because of the complexity of interactions between salmon, trout, and the animals that eat them, it is at present difficult, or impossible, to derive good predictive models of the effects of manipulating habitats under many circumstances.},

	abstract = {The need for integration across spatial and temporal scales in applying science to the management of Atlantic salmon is considered. The factors that are currently believed to affect the production of anadromous adult Atlantic salmon (synthesized from recent reviews) are arranged in a hierarchy in which any given process overrides those processes at lower levels. There is not a good correlation between levels in the process hierarchy and levels in hierarchies of scale. This demonstrates the importance of integrating across scales in identifying the optimum foci for targeting management action. It is not possible to generalize on the need for integration across scales within management plans. This is because of the complex ecology of salmon, the broad range of characteristics of the systems of which they are a part, and the fact that both local scale and broad scale management can have broad scale effects. Many uncertainties remain regarding the large-scale components of the ecology of salmon, the way that small-scale mechanisms interact with life histories, and the way that different factors interact to limit production of fish. When more is understood of these processes, it is likely that generalized rules might be developed to predict the management requirements for stream systems. In the meantime, it is essential that there is good integration among managers working at different scales and it is important that management systems operating at all spatial scales include high-calibre expertise to compensate for the present paucity of general rules.},

This study aims at reconstructing the chronology of late Pleistocene glacial fluctuations in the Aubrac Mountains. We present a new set of Be-10 and Al-26 exposure ages from twenty erratic boulders embedded in six glacial landforms. Glacial landforms were sampled to determine the timing of three glacial stades and the deglaciation of the Aubrac Mountains. These new data allowed us to constrain the timing of: (i) the Local Last Glacial Maximum, which is coeval with the early Marine Isotopic Stage 2 (MIS 2) (28–24 ka), and (ii) the Grandvals and Bouquincan stades, which are both coeval with the late MIS 2 (24–16 ka). Deglaciation occurred during Heinrich Stadial 1 (18–15.6 ka). This new direct glacial chronology is supported by regional paleoenvironmental proxies and it updates the chronostratigraphic framework available for the southwestern Massif Central. Western European atmospheric circulation changes (i.e., a southward shift in North Atlantic storm tracks and Mediterranean influences) during MIS 2 were identified as significant factors controlling glacier growth in the Aubrac Mountains as well as other glaciated mountains within the southwestern Massif Central, such as the Cantal, Margeride and Lozère mountains.},

	abstract = {Glacier-erosion rates range across orders of magnitude, and much of this variation cannot be attributed to basal sliding rates. Subglacial till acts as lubricating ‘fault gouge’ or ‘sawdust’, and must be removed for rapid subglacial bedrock erosion. Such erosion occurs especially where and when moulin-fed streams access the bed and are unconstrained by supercooling or other processes. Streams also may directly erode bedrock, likely with strong time-evolution. Erosion is primarily by quarrying, aided by strong fluctuations in the water system driven by variable surface melt and by subglacial earthquakes. Debris-bed friction significantly affects abrasion, quarrying and general glacier flow. Frost heave drives cirque headwall erosion as winter cold air enters bergschrunds, creating temperature gradients to drive water flow along premelted films to growing ice lenses that fracture rock, and the glacier removes the resulting blocks. Recent subglacial bedrock erosion and sediment flux are in many cases much higher than long-term averages. Over glacial cycles, evolution of glacial-valley form feeds back strongly on erosion and deposition. Most of this is poorly quantified, with parts open to argument. Glacial erosion and interactions are important to tectonic and volcanic processes as well as climate and biogeochemical fluxes, motivating vigorous research.},

Remote sensing provides data that drive biophysical models of Earth-surface processes, as well as mapping discrete land cover and land-use change information and landform maps. Land cover remote sensing has also spurred land-change science, an emergent paradigm linking anthropogenic and natural-system change dynamics using predictive models. This chapter reviews the state of remote sensing applied to land-cover dynamics, provides selected case studies, and surveys future challenges and advances in light of increasing anthropogenic changes on the landscape.},

	isbn = {978-0-444-53642-6},
	abstract = {Fluvial sediments consist of channel (channel bar, channel fill) and overbank (natural levee, crevasse splay, flood basin) deposits. Channel deposits are comprised predominantly of sand and gravel and typically occur as lenticular bodies or thick tabular sheets with complex bedding geometries and erosive bases. Overbank deposits consist primarily of silt and clay and lesser amounts of sand, and often encase sand bodies. Organic and chemical sediments such as peat and carbonate can be important constituents of overbank sediments in humid and arid settings, respectively. Fluvial sediments are present in a diverse array of environments that range from tectonically quiescent continental interiors to actively subsiding continental margins and foreland basins. The geologic setting controls the abundance of fluvial sediments, the completeness of the record of fluvial activity, and the architecture of the deposits. In continental interiors where erosion predominates, fluvial sediments are often represented by down-stepping flights of terraces underlain by sand and/or gravel. Fine-grained overbank deposits are often rare in these settings. Periods of fluvial aggradation and sediment reworking are punctuated by river incision and soil formation. Records of fluvial activity in these settings are relatively incomplete. Along continental margins, fluvial sediments are represented by relative thick successions of muddy overbank and sandy channel deposits. Stacked deposits of Quaternary fluvial sediments in these settings provide relatively complete and long-term records of fluvial activity.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.09.009},
	abstract = {Network-scale heterogeneity in fluvial forms and processes has been analyzed for decades through the field-based characterization of a reduced number of sites. Spatially continuous data sets are increasingly available at a national scale (e.g., digital elevation models or aerial orthophotographs) and open up new possibilities to investigate spatial structures in stream networks. The paper introduces a GIS methodological framework to support and automate the large-scale characterization of the fluvial system based on spatial disaggregation and aggregation procedures. The spatial disaggregation consists in the longitudinal discretisation of geographical objects into relatively high resolution spatial units to characterize fluvial features continuously along stream networks. Because rivers are heterogeneous and hierarchically organized, the spatial aggregation aims to delineate statistically pattern or process-based spatial units to answer questions at appropriate scales. The paper develops the GIS implementation of the disaggregation and aggregation procedures for characterizing stream networks in a geomorphic perspective. We illustrate the approach on the Rhône network, focusing on the characterization of three geographical objects commonly used in classification schemes: the streamline, the valley bottom, and the active channel (the latter on a limited area). The spatial aggregation is automated using the threshold test of Pettitt (1979) to detect change points in univariate data series and delineate homogeneous spatial units throughout the stream network. We provide three simple application examples to illustrate the potentialities of the spatial aggregation to investigate spatial heterogeneity in stream networks. Finally, insights, limitations and future challenging issues emerging from the application of the methodological framework are discussed.},
